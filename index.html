        <h3>About</h3>

        <p>
          Cervantes Energy holds, through its 100% owned subsidiary Rural
          Capital Unu, a wind farm project under development in Romania. The
          project is based on 300 hectares of land in the municipality of
          Braila, which have been fully purchased for the project. The
          permitting of the land for the purpose of a 100+MW windfarm are well
          advanced, and negotiations with developer/constructors ongoing with a
          view to bring the project to completion as a working generating
          facility.
